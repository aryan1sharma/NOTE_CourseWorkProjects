# Note
This repo exists to notify (particularly recruiters) of all my coursework projects being private (can see it after making a request).

**Due to coursework policy, all of the source code for my coursework projects/assignments cannot be made public (to curb cheating, and maintain the academic conduct agreement).**

Please send me a message on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aryansharma1/) if you would like to see my work (and by extension my skills).
